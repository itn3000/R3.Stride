# R3.Stride

R3 integration with Stride(WIP)

* [R3](https://github.com/Cysharp/R3)
* [Stride](https://stride3d.net)

# Usage

1. Reference R3.Stride3d
2. add empty Entity by Stride editor
3. add "R3/Stride3dFrameProviderComponent"
4. set Stride3d Frame Provider Component's priority to lower than other scripts which use R3 API

# TODO

* Naming(Is "Stride3d" OK?)
* API visibility(Currently, almost public)
